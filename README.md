## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

centering Absolute elements is easier with the ``` transform:translate(); ```
also ``` margin: auto; ``` saves life

### Continued development

Would continue to learn the transform and the possibilities it brings.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me with the centering issue. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
